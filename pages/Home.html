          in the European Union in 2002 and restricts the use of six hazardous
          materials found in electrical and electronics products.

          <b>REACH</b> is a European Union regulation fating from 18 December,
          2006. It addresses the production and use of chemical substances, and
          their potential impacts on both human and the environment.<br />
          When REACH is fully in force, it will require all companies
          manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the EU in
          quantities of one tonne or more per year to register these substances
          with a new European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki, Finland. It
          also addresses the continued use of chemical substances of very high
          concern (SVHC) because of their potential negative impacts on human
          health or the environment. <br />
