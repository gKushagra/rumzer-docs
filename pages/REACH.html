      <b>REACH</b> is a regulation of the European Union. It stands for
      Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals. It
      entered into force on June 1, 2007. It was adopted to imporve the
      protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be
      posed by chemicals, while enhancing the competitiveness of the EU
      chemicals industry. It also promotes alternative methods for hazard
      assessment of substances in order to reduce the number of tests on
      animals.
      <br />
      REACH applies to chemical substances, not only those used in industries,
      but also those that are used on daily basis. Therefore, it has an impact
      on most companies in EU.
      <br />
      Companies have to demonstrate to ECHA how a substance can be safely used.
      If the risks cannot be managed, authorities can restrict the use of
      substances in different ways.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Process</b> <br>
      <br />
      REACH establishes procedures for collecting and assessing information on
      the properties and hazards of substances. <br />
      <b>Step 1:</b> Companies need to register their substances. <br />
      <b>Step 2:</b> ECHA receives and evaluates registrations for their
      compliance, and the EU Member States evaluate selected substances to
      clarify inintial concerns for human health or for the environment.
      Authorities assess whether the risks of substances can be managed. <br />
      <b>Step 3:</b> If the risks are unmanageable, the substance is banned.
      Otherwise authorised. <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Effect of REACH on companies</b> <br /> <br>
      <b>Manufacturers:</b> Companies that produce chemicals have important
      responsibilities under REACH. <br />
      <b>Importers:</b> Companies that import chemicals from outside EU/EEA have
      important responsibilities under REACH. <br />
      <b>Donwstream Users:</b> Companies that handle chemicals have some responsibility
      under REACH. <br />
      <b>Companies established outside the EU:</b> Such companies are not bound by EU.
      Rather, importers within EU that import chemicals from companies outside
      EU have important responsibilities under REACH.
