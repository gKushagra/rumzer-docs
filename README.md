<h1>Rumzer Docs</h1>
<p>
Rumzer Docs provides information about 
RoHS, REACH, and Proposition 65 compliance 
regulations.
</p>
<p>
I implemented this website while 
going through the regulations in the 
rulebooks.
<br> <br>
It provides a brief overview of the
compliance regulations in case someone
needs a quick reference.
<br> <br>
There are grammatical errors, which i will correct 
soon. Also, the information is collected from these websites
and may be the same as provided on these websites.

RoHS: https://www.rohsguide.com/ <br>
REACH: https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach/understanding-reach <br>
Prop 65: https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65 <br>

With time, i will try to convey the information in my own words
as accurately as possible.
